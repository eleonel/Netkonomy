GMapLocation module (http://drupal.org/project/gmaplocation)

** Description:
The GMapLocation module is a simple module designed to display a single geographic location via Google Maps for a website. It has following features:

* Creates a single Google Maps page (at http://yoursite.com/gmaplocation), designed to display one location for the site, with an address marker.
* The map location is automatically geocoded from a street address.
* Anyone with administer GMapLocation permissions can drag the marker to further fine-tune its position if geocoding did not place the marker exactly where you wish it to be.
* Creates a block with a static image of the centre of the map, which links to the Google Map page on your site.

GMapLocation module is simple by design and will remain that way. It creates only a single Google Map for a site. It is not designed to attach locations to nodes, users, or other content. If you wish any of these more extensive features, see the GMap project (http://drupal.org/project/gmap) which is significantly more powerful and is designed to do all of these things.
